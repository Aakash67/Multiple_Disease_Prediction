# Multiple Disease Prediction System Web App

This repository contains a web application that predicts multiple diseases using machine learning models. The web app is built using Streamlit and allows users to input relevant medical parameters for different diseases and receive predictions.

## Project Structure

- `collab_notebook/`: Contains the Jupyter Notebook(s) used for data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.

- `Models/`: Contains the trained machine learning models serialized using pickle.

- `system.py`: The main Python file for the Streamlit web application.

- `requirements.txt`: List of required Python packages and their versions.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.7 or higher
- Streamlit (`pip install streamlit`)
- Required libraries (automatically installed via `requirements.txt`):
  - scikit-learn
  - numpy
  - streamlit-option-menu
  - pickle-mixin

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/multiple-disease-prediction.git
   cd multiple-disease-prediction
2. Install the required packages from the requirements.txt file:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
### Usage
1. Navigate to the project directory:
```bash
cd multiple-disease-prediction
```
2. Run the Streamlit web app:
```
streamlit run system.py
```
Access the web app in your browser by opening the displayed URL (usually http://localhost:8501).

Choose a disease from the sidebar menu, input the relevant medical parameters, and click the corresponding button to get the disease prediction.
## Datasets
